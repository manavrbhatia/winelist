            "Notes": "This Beringer Sonoma Coast wine is 100% Pinot Noir and opens with beautiful and inviting aromas of red cherry, strawberry and black tea. The nose leads to a core of juicy fruit flavors where the red fruit flavors standout alongside touches of brown spice adding depth and complexity. The hallmark cool-climate structure is balanced by generous fruit and bright acidity and makes this well-rounded wine very food friendly.",

This blend of Zinfandel and Cabernet Sauvignon with supporting notes of Merlot was fermented in a stainless steel tank, producing a slightly sweet, rich red with notes of strawberry, cherry, and a hint of clove.",
